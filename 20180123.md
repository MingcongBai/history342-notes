Professor: Judd Kinzley (金家德)

Introduction and Goals
----------------------

The course aims to provide tools to contextualise and construct the history of
modern China, and its recent "rise" on the international stage.

And...

- To construct a broader historical image, as post-1978 China is now
  presented as the "de facto" figure for this new world power.
    - "Opening and Reform" marking the end of Maoist government.
    - The construction of party-central authoritarianism and the incorporation
      (or integration) of Capitalism into "Socialism with Chinese Features".

And to pose questions...

- Why is Mao still important today, why is he still relevant in Chinese
  culture, society, and governmental infrastrutures?
- What is the importance of the period of 1949 - 1978, why is it important
  to understand its foundamental significance for present-day China?

Contextualising Mao in Post-1978 China
--------------------------------------

- Mao's resonance as a political figure, a military leader, and a thinker.
- Importance of his images, icons, and symbolism.

Course Schedule
---------------

- Briefly recap the contents of History 341, regarding the late Qing Dynasty,
  and the Revolutionary-Republican-Revolution periods.
- Mass movements and government organisations in early People's Republic.
- Death of Mao, Party response, and their effort to maintain order.
- Reconstruction of Party authority in Post-Cultral Revolution period
  (1976-1978).
- Growth of economy with integration of Capitalist markets.
- Rapid expansion of governmental corruption as a product of economical fusion?
  Authoritarianism in a Capitalist market, social unrest, and government
  suppression of dissiments.
- Rebirth of Nationalism, and reimagining Communism and Socialism in a
  contemporary context.

Other Objectives?
-----------------

- To contextualise, and in some cases, to deconstruct stereotypes of China.
- Detailed survey of Maoist politics and its features.
- Reflections of Chinese memories of the People's Republic - or to understand
  the love-hate emotions held in their memories.
    - To understand the uniqueness of Chinese government frameworks, and its
      implementation of a authoritarianist government. For example, the
      self-proclaimed "People's Democratic Dictatorship", and "Concentrated
      Democracy".
    - To understand and to construct historical sympathy for the Chinese
      history and society - and for the choices made by the government and
      the people.
- To present a conflicting world view held by the Chinese people,
  and "outsiders".
- To present, discuss, and contextualise topics difficult to be openly
  discussed in China (Tiananmen Incident, and increasingly, the Cultural
  Revolution and the Great Leap Forward).
    - The event, and the reason for the difficulty.

On Historical Narrative and Sympathy
------------------------------------

- Credits and criticism due for the Chinese Communist Party in its ruling
  history?
- Reasons for the Party's sustained position in China?
- The history of the developing governmental censorship?
- History as a matter of opinions and choices...

Topics of Interest Pointed Out by the Students
----------------------------------------------

- Sino-Soviet diplomacy as a driving force in the history of the Cold War.
- China (Mainland) relationship with Taiwan, and other diasporic groups...
    - Incorporation or separation?
    - Historical uniqueness.
- The 1980s, development and expansion of governmental corruption, and the
  long-term struggle for legitimacy and trust.
    - Aftermath, or consequences?
    - Chinese people's own share of "guilt" and responsibility?
- Political participation, by whom and when? Chinese Communist Party's
  abilities, advantages, and disavantages in mass organisation and distribution
  of political power.
- Uniqueness of Chinese implementation of Socialism and Communist ideologies,
  as compared to Soviet-aligned states, and North Korea (as a contemporary
  topic).

Expectations
------------

- Mutual respect and open-mindedness in one's best effort - and in
  acknowledgement of China's controversial topics.
- Avoid extended conversations with classmates during lectures.
- Computers are allowed, but it is expected that they are used in interest
  of academic work.
