China and the Qing Dynasty
--------------------------

What is China?

- A vast nation of massive population, where the dominant ethnic roup is the
  "Han", contributing to ~92% of Chinese population today, and one of the
  fifty-six ethnic groups by definition of the People's Republic of China.
- There is no single and unchanging China throughout its history.
    - Challenging the self-proclaimed "five thousands of history".
    - Han was not always the ruling ethnicity (though for most of known
      history Han has been the dominant ethnicity in terms of number).
    - The notion of "Han" was not clearly defined until the Republican
      Revolution of 1911, and in years followed - where Han nationalism
      grew in struggle against Manchu rulers of the Qing Dynasty.

The Qing Dynasty...

- A Dynasty founded by the Manchus who conquered and ruled China since 1644.
- Ruling China as an empire, and the last (fow now) imperial dynasty in Chinese
  history - or arguably, Qing ruled China as a (dominant, or major) component
  of its East Asian Empire.
    - In its largely unsuccessful effort to replace Han Chinese as the dominant
      ethnicity in the empire, they resorted to integrate elements of Han
      cultural elements (such as Confucianism and Chinese text, along with
      Manchu scripture). After all, a division between the Han and Manchu
      ethnicity was formed (which will come back to haunt them in the eve
      of the Republican Revolution), and to an extent, the Manchus lost parts
      of their own ethnic identity while becoming increasingly similar in
      living habits and cultures when compared to their Han counterpart.
    - Ethnic issues had been one of the most significant (and direct) cause to
      social unrests and riots throughout the history of Qing.

Manchu-Han Tensions

- As mentioned above, the Manchus gave great effort to reach out to Han Chinese
  by embracing elements of Han culture, and hired numerous Han elites to
  governmental positions through a national examination system - inherited from
  preceeding dynasties.
- Massive imperial expansions in the late 17th and 18th centuries resulted in
  borderlines similar to contemporary China - and with that, the ruling group
  became more exposed to sub-divided Han cultures found in different
  territorial regions. However, with that in mind...
    - Wealth and trading opportunities greatly expanded.
    - Easing indirectly the ethnic tensions with new social welfares and
      opportunities provided. However, these issues were replaced with new
      challenges - both domestically, and internationally.

Challenges for the Qing
-----------------------

Domestic Issues...

- Overpopulation (or more precisely, overcrowding, especially in major cities
  and rural regions).
    - Lack of opportunities for educated elites, mostly Han elites.
    - Land shortage for agricultural production (and note the importance of
      agriculture in China).
    - *Failed by its own success?*

Aftermaths...

- Growing popular discontent, and resulting in rebellions and unrests: Boxer
  Rebellion, the Empire of Heavenly Peace - struggles of orders and cultures.
- In general, increased difficulty for the Qing court to govern over a greatly
  diversified population (even via proxies of local governments) over a vast
  territory.
- Growing skepticism of the Qing court among various social classes - though
  expressed in different actions (rebellions in the rural towns, and power
  struggles in and around the imperial court, etc.).

The "emergence" of the West...

*It should be noted that Western interaction was not an invention during the
era of Qing, however, it was not until Qing that China was increasingly
influenced and replaced by the West as the dominant world power.*

- Long history of interactions with the West, in the times of Qing and former
  dynasties: missionaries (religions), traders (commodity markets), and
  diplomats (politics).
- A shifting landscape of international power structure, following the
  industrialisation and rapid urbanisation of the early 19th century -
  accompanied by rapid growth of colonial empires such as the British Empire.

New markets, and new demands...

- Britain become more aggressive in their effort to open new sites of trades
  to gain moreaccess to Chinese products and consumers of their industrial
  products.
    - Increasing tension with the Qing court, as the Qing court refused to
      open more trading ports.
    - The tension (and perhaps in parts, misunderstanding), led to the outbreak
      of naval wars, first exemplified in the First Opium War between the
      British Empire and Qing (1839 - 1842).

A series of wars followed - mostly agitated by foreign industrial powers (while
mostly of European locales, Japan should be included in this categroy) - and
followed by unequal and harsh treaties imposed after Chinese defeats: treaty
ports, concessions, and other imperialist impositions... Invading Chinese
domestic rights, espeically in regards to legislation and criminal punishments.

Such threats and loss prompted the Qing court to evaluate for appropriate
response to the Western, and industrial powers...

- To embrace the need for change and to implement and localise Western
  technologies and thoughts?
- To reject the West and take the hardline policy against Western influences
  and impositions?

While Qing took the latter option, the Western countries decided to "educate"
the Qing court and its fellow Chinese people, through means of war and violent
atrocities. While the Western powers saw it as their "duty" (perhaps "Christian
duty") to punish China and force them into the modern world, it prompted
Chinese response to strengthen itself, and to learn from the West as one of
the means to "catch up".

The Bleak Road Ahead
--------------------

The Qing Dynasty and China are more generally seemed to be in mortal danger
by the end of the 19th century... As foreign powers carved for their own share
of rights within Qing territory, and to exploit the people for their own
economic gain.

This then posed a question to Qing elites and its people in general: how can
China be saved?

The Legacies of the Imperial Powers in China
--------------------------------------------

- Destabilised and undermined the legitimacy of Qing rule.
- Prompted the growth of Han Nationalism - in opposition to Manchu rulers. And
  in general, yet another consolidation of a Han identity and ethnic cohesion.
- A powerful, yet enduring sense of humiliation.
    - What could humiliation serve to a population and a nation, and to its
      ruling class?
